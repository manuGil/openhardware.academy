## Why to partner up?
### Lets join forces! ðŸ’ª
- **Are you a student?** Students are and will always be our main partners and source of inspiration, we were all students, and Delft Open Hardware is a student and alumni initiative. Would you like to work on an internship for an open source project, or as part of your thesis? Let us know, we would love to help.

---
- **Would you and or your organization benefit from training on open source hardware?** We have some experience teaching technical skills including hardware design and programming, take advantage of this experience and the best practices we have gathered in the community. You could do this by participating in the designing of new lessons or by presenting in an open hardware academy seminar.
---

- **Are you looking for talented and passionate developers working on open hardware projects?** Then joining the community will not hurt you, and probably will get you connected with new interesting people.

---
- **Are you teaching or planning to teach on open source related aspects?** Why not join forces with others doing the same?

---
- **Do you have a startup or initiative? And are yu passionate about open source?** Then this might be a good place to get feedback and find contributors, or partners.
